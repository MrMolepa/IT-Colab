                    The Examinations Council of Lesotho (ECoL) serves as the
                    authority responsible for developing, overseeing, and
                    maintaining a robust assessment system for Basic Education
                    that addresses Lesotho's educational requirements. ECoL
                    administers the Grade 7 End-of-Level Assessment, which gauges
                    learners' attainment of learning goals as they transition to
                    the Secondary Phase. Additionally, ECoL manages Grade 11
                    public examinations for the Lesotho General Certificate of
                    Secondary Education (LGCSE), a qualification endorsed by the
                    National University of Lesotho (NUL) for quality assurance.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-justify">
                    ECoL is also entrusted with conducting the biennial Lesotho
                    National Assessment of Educational Progress (LNAEP) Survey in
                    Grades 4 and 6. This survey, conducted on behalf of the
                    Ministry of Education and Training (MoET), monitors the
                    progress of the country's education system.

                  <p className="text-justify">
                    Furthermore, ECoL offers services including evaluating foreign
                    results, printing replacement certificates, issuing migration
                    certificates, verifying foreign results and certificates, as
                    well as administering English proficiency tests. These
                    services are accessible online for enhanced efficiency,
                    effectiveness, and client convenience.
